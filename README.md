# Fahrenheit-to-C-and-K-Calculator
First, the user will enter a temperature using the Fahrenheit temperature scale and the app will display the Celsius conversion and the Kelvin conversion. Supply the user with a handy chart displayed in a single ListBox formatted with three columns, one for F, one for C, and one for K.  This ListBox will be filled at startup with all of the values for the Fahrenheit scale from the freezing point of water to the boiling point (32F to 212F).
